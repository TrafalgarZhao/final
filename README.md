Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

## Analysis

- `The relationship between the number of players and the earnings of the game`
As the number of game players increases, developers can make more money from game competitions,  we can also see which game earns more money, because there some standout point. To some degree, there is a positive correlation between revenue and the number of players.
- `The relationship between publication time and game earnings`
We can look at the release dates of different game genres to see which games are popular at the moment and recommend which genres to develop. For example, collect card games tend to become more popular, while RPG and FPS games tend to become less popular, but they still bring a certain amount of revenue to developers. Or it could be that classic games still make a lot of money, but new games developed in recent years don't meet the expectations of the public, which means that the revenue of such games is not as good as before. In general, we feel that developers can focus on such games, like collect card games, which may become more and more popular.
- `The relationship between the number of games created and the games earnings`
While some games can bring in a certain amount of money with a few matches, in a way, the more matches, the more money the matches bring in. We felt that the tournament itself might have a promotional effect, which would attract more players, which would bring new players to the tournament and continue to generate revenue for the developer. This could bring in a lot of money if it can be recycled over the long term. So we think developers can hold games competitions.
- `The popularity of different genres in different countries`
You can see what kind of game in which country is the most popular, for example, the strategy games are the most popular in Taiwan, the most popular sport game in Portugal, because this kind of game between the two countries make the most money in the graph, and this may be because the different tastes of different countries, like the Portuguese football atmosphere is better, So they prefer sports games. So developers can release different types of games in different countries, which can reduce unnecessary losses.

`Why people like play MOBA and MOBA can earn a lot of money?`

It's simple because MOBAs just meet people's game needs. Traditional MMORPGs require a lot of time. They need fixed online time every day. In other words, it takes a lot of time and money in the early stage to get a sense of accomplishment in the later stage. And the sense of achievement is directly proportional to the time and money. The more you invest, the greater your sense of accomplishment. The MOBA is quite different. First of all, it's very competitive. This is hard to achieve in MMORPGs, and even though the PVP system in Mmos is as good as it gets and the battles are intense, it's still not the core of the game. MOBA, on the other hand, was born to "compete" since its birth. Second, the game environment is more balanced. Because in an MMO, players are inherently unbalanced. From race selection at the start, skill sets, unions you join, teammates you choose, there are imbalances in every category. In addition, among the factors affecting "sense of achievement", MOBA also has a third dimension, "talent", in addition to the two dimensions of time and money. In other words, a MOBA with a lot of talent, even with little time and money, can achieve no less, even more than a player who spends a lot of money but has no talent. Because each round of MOBA starts from the state of balance, only the level of individual ability can affect the result. Finally, it comes down to time. MMO you need hundreds, thousands of hours before you really enjoy the game. But in this era of fragmented time, most players can't devote three or more hours a day to a game. The reason mobile gaming is so popular right now is because it captures the potential of fragmented time. MOBA also happens to be the same, the average game time is about 40 minutes, one game a day to relax, but also can switch between multiple heroes, even multiple games, avoid the game will produce a feeling of boredom, each game to keep fresh and unknown. This is a very tempting attribute for most players. For competitive games, MOBAs are a step further than traditional RTS. Maybe that's why MOBA can get such amount of income.
