## Analysis
- `The relationship between the number of players and the earnings of the game`
As the number of game players increases, developers can make more money from game competitions,  we can also see which game earns more money, because there some standout point. To some degree, there is a positive correlation between revenue and the number of players.
- `The relationship between publication time and game earnings`
We can look at the release dates of different game genres to see which games are popular at the moment and recommend which genres to develop. For example, collect card games tend to become more popular, while RPG and FPS games tend to become less popular, but they still bring a certain amount of revenue to developers. Or it could be that classic games still make a lot of money, but new games developed in recent years don't meet the expectations of the public, which means that the revenue of such games is not as good as before. In general, we feel that developers can focus on such games, like collect card games, which may become more and more popular.
- `The relationship between the number of games created and the games earnings`
While some games can bring in a certain amount of money with a few matches, in a way, the more matches, the more money the matches bring in. We felt that the tournament itself might have a promotional effect, which would attract more players, which would bring new players to the tournament and continue to generate revenue for the developer. This could bring in a lot of money if it can be recycled over the long term. So we think developers can hold games competitions.
- `The popularity of different genres in different countries`
You can see what kind of game in which country is the most popular, for example, the strategy games are the most popular in Taiwan, the most popular sport game in Portugal, because this kind of game between the two countries make the most money in the graph, and this may be because the different tastes of different countries, like the Portuguese football atmosphere is better, So they prefer sports games. So developers can release different types of games in different countries, which can reduce unnecessary losses.
